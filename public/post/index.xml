      <description>TL;DR I use Single Value Decomposition (SVD) to approximate photos of my own face and check if Appleâ€™s Photos app can still recognize my face at low rank levels. I find that the Photo app can recognize my face at rank 25, a 98% decrease in storage size from the original image. I hypothesize that SVD works particularly well on faces because of facial symmetry.
*Code for this project can be found on Github right here.</description>

      <description>TL;DR Wealth, social support, and life expectancy all seem to correlate strongly with happiness across countries. Corruption appears to correlate negatively with happiness, though outliers exist. Generosity does not seem to correlate with happiness at all, though the proxy for generosity (donating to a charity within the last month) seems ill-adapted to capture the kinds of informal help offered between members of distinct communities that dominate poorer and politically fragile countries.</description>
