      <description>TL;DR Wealth, social support, and life expectancy all seem to correlate strongly with happiness across countries. Generosity and corruption levels within a country do not, though data on these metrics is sparser and seems more prone to noisy and biased self-reporting.
I used the World Happiness Report for all measures related to happiness, and the World Bank 2019 population data for country populations.

      <description>My name is Avery Rogers, and I&amp;rsquo;m a student at Stanford University completing my MS in computer science and BA in economics. I&amp;rsquo;m fascinated by the world of data and statistics and am actively seeking a job in data science and analytics. My favorite package suite is R&amp;rsquo;s tidyverse ecosystem, and most of my work is done there.
When I&amp;rsquo;m not coding, I love going for night runs around the Stanford campus, getting overly competitive in team sports, and singing while playing amateur guitar.</description>
