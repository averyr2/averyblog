<p>For this project, I investigate how much I can reduce the storage space needed to store a black-and-white photo of my face still have Apple’s facial recognition system recognize me! I will be using Single Value Decomposition to reduce a photo to a lower-rank matrix of grey pixel values that can be stored in a fraction of the space as the original photo.</p>

In order to process this image using Single Value Decomposition (SVD), I need to make it black and white by setting each pixel value to the average over its RGB values. This is because SVD’s computations are achievable over a 2x2 matrix, but solving SVD on a tensor (3 dimensional matrix) is NP-hard.</p>
