<p>I will admit that I’m historically something of a crypto skeptic - blame a mix of risk aversion and Silicon Valley’s grandiose delusions. But as passes its 12th anniversary, I have come to accept that crypto is here to stay. As a result, I figured I might as well understand its meteoric rise and figure out where it’s headed.</p>
<p>First, I look at Bitcoin’s rise, along with the rise in miner revenue. Hindsight is painful, per usual.</p>

<p>We see that it was better to be an investor than a miner from 2016 to 2021 in terms of percentage growth, although I regret not being either!</p>
