<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Wealth, social support, and life expectancy all seem to correlate strongly with happiness across countries. Generosity and corruption levels within a country do not, though data on these metrics is sparser and seems more prone to noisy and biased self-reporting.</p>
<hr />
<p>I used the World Happiness Report for all measures related to happiness, and the World Bank 2019 population data for country populations.</p>
<p>World Happiness Report 2021 Data: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report-2021" class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report-2021</a>
World Bank 2019 Data: <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL" class="uri">https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, North Cyprus, Palestinian Territories, and Taiwan do not exist in the World Bank Data, so we will leave them out of our analysis.</p>
<p>I’m not super satisfied with the regional breakdown provided by the Happiness records, since there are too many for my taste. At the risk of losing granularity, I am going to combine some of the regions.</p>

<p>We notice that log GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, social support, and freedom of choice have fairly uniformly positive impacts on subjective well-being. Generosity and perceptions of corruption have less obvious relationships to subjective well-being across countries in 2020.</p>
<p>Let us look at effects over time.</p>
<p>Let’s see which countries got progressively better over this time period:</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the regions and how they changed over this time period, on average:</p>
