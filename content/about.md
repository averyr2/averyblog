My name is Avery Rogers, and I'm a student at Stanford University completing my MS in computer science and BA in economics. I'm fascinated by the world of data and statistics and am actively seeking a job in data science and analytics. My favorite package suite is R's [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) ecosystem, and most of my work is done there.

When I'm not coding, I love going for night runs around the Stanford campus, getting overly competitive in team sports, and playing singing while playing amateur guitar. I grew up in Denver and San Diego and have concluded that mountains are better. :)
